                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Please be aware that although we do give you permission to reach out to us with your questions and concerns, we are <span class="em fw-bolder text-danger">NOT</span> obligated to respond -- even if legal action is threatened or attempted against us.</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-2">We are a small indie studio, and while we value your feedback, we cannot guarantee a response to every inquiry. However, we will do our best to address any issues that arise.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2">We herby declare that any attempts at legal actions brought against us will be deemed invalid on account of heresay, attempted legal drama, any form of legal action based on misinformation, attempted interferance against our company (<em>which - by the way - is a serious federal crime here in the USA where we are located... not to mention it's a massive breach of ethics in the corporate world... one that I will definitely use against you to force you to back off...</em>), lack of understanding and or knowledge of our interworkings that nobody but us should know anyways.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2">If you plan to contact us about our use of Generative AI... then sorry, but you should just go take a long walk off a short pier covered in fish paste into shark infested waters... why? Because we don't care about any negative opinions about the use of Generative AI technology. It's a useful tool for indie game dev studios as small as ours, so we'll continue using it.</p>
                            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">(<em>Law Enforcement or any law related entity: If you attemt to contact us or force us into a courtroom then you will be ignored UNLESS you or your client can PROVIDE IRRIFUTABLE PROOF IN ADVANCE that we are guilty of what we are being summoned for. If not, then consider this statement here to be our official demand for both a Cease and Desist and a Restraining order to curb any future attempts to cause senselessly expensive and wasteful legal atlercations that never needed to happen in the first place. Furthermore, if the reason behind the attempted legal action can be viewed in any way as a power grab, interferance against our products and or company, or even greed -- then WE WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CLAIMS and will file permanent Restraining and Cease & Desist orders against your party.</em>)</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Thank you for your understanding and support!</p>
